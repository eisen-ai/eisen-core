    Logging object aiming at printing on the console the progress of model training/validation/testing.
    This logger uses an event based system. The training, validation and test workflows emit events such as
    EISEN_END_BATCH_EVENT and EISEN_END_EPOCH_EVENT which are picked up by this object and handled.

    Once the user instantiates such object, the workflow corresponding to the ID passes as argument will be
    tracked and the results of the workflow in terms of losses and metrics will be printed on the console
